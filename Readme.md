This is a KoLMafia interface for the skill progression tracking available on plasticlobster.com

Guide
=====

To install, type:
----------------------
<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/plasticlobster/kol-skills/branches/Release
</pre>

in your KoLMafia CLI


To update, type:
----------------------
<pre>
svn update plasticlobster-kol-skills-branches-Release
svn sync
</pre>
svn sync is necessary because sometimes KoLMafia doesn't move updates to the scripts folder.

To remove:
----------------------
<pre>
svn delete plasticlobster-kol-skills-branches-Release
</pre>

Usage:
----------------------
Similar to the various "snapshot" scripts out there, this one will check your account for permed skills and direct you to a page that shows you how you're progressing.
The skill breakdowns are periodically updated based on the KoLWiki's Hardcore Skill Analysis page, so those who are perming skills in accordance with that page may find this script and supporting web site helpful.
